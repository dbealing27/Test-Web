			   <h1>Our Homes</h1>
			   <p>LK Eco-Wise Homes offers our clients a complete solution, from design and construction, to power generation, heating, ventilation, interior design and landscaping.</p>
			   <p>We provide a one-stop shop for sustainable living. We use the most updated energy efficient products to meet our high standard of eco-friendly home.</p>
			   &nbsp;
			   <h2>Hot water</h2>
			   <p>Solar hot water collectors, fitted at the time of construction, add minimally to overall cost of the home but ensure a year-round supply of reliable hot water, backed up by gas bottle heating when required.</p>
				&nbsp;
			   <h2>Power supply</h2>
			   <p>Power is stored in deep cycle batteries in the custom-designed power room alongside the house. An inverter is used to convert the deep cycle battery power into AC power that can be used to run appliances in the house as usual. All our homes carry solar, wind turbine and bio-fuel generation.</p>
			   &nbsp;
			   <h2>Landscaping</h2>
			   <p>LK Landscaping comes as a part of our Eco-Wise homes package:</p>
			   
			   <ul>
				<li>We work to preseve trees and natural vegetation during construction if the existing plants will be beneficial to the home.</li>
				<li>Our planners take into account the whole building site, not just the house, to create an environmentally sustainable haven.</li>
				<li>We do just as well with an inner city pocket-sized section as a rural sprawl.</li>
				<li>One or two perfectly selected and placed trees can be add substantially to attractiveness of your property, provide shelter and shade and a haven for birds.</li>
			   </ul>
			   <p>If we aren't careful, our homes can become laden with all sort of irritants.</p>
			   <ul>
			    <li>Natural window treatments that are easy to clean, like wooden slatted blind, provide a far better option for a dust-free environment.</li>
				<li>All our new homes allow for comprehensive heat pump systems and all standard designs have been pre-tested for maximum efficiency for winter heating, summer air conditioning, and clean air inside the house.</li>
				<li>We use only non-toxic paints, glues, sealants and finishing treatments.</li>
			   </ul>
				&nbsp;  
			   
			   <h2>Our Designs</h2>
			   <p>We design our homes to fit and blend with the natural environment. Our popular designs include:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Tui</li>
				<li>Kereru</li>
				<li>Pukeko</li>
				<li>Fantail</li>
